# Requirements

Write an angular component that accepts a numerical start and end input. 
The user can click a "Play FizzBuzz" button which calculates the fizzbuzz results and shows
the results in an ordered list.

## FizzBuzz rules.
The rules for FizzBuzz are as follows.
- If the input is a multiple of three print “Fizz” instead of the number;
- and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”;
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz";
- For any other number just print the number.
